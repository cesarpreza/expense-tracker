# Summary

A simple but fun project. Similar to my To-Do application, only this time to manage money, the user can add expenses to the table.
taking what I learned in my previous projects I see how I've grown and how much I've learned so far. There is still so much to learn but in finishing this project
I will continue to grow and gain more and more skills. This was a fun application to make and I definitley will come back to it to refactor and add some more styling.
